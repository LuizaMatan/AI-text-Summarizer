This is a simple user-friendly application that takes in a long text or conversation
and summarizes it using AI (BART model). It is built with Streamlit and Hugging Face 
Transformers.
The BART model is denoising autoencoder that is a pretrained seq2seq and uses masked 
language modelling for natural langugage generation and translation.
